# DelugeBOT
A web browser bot for https://www.delugerpg.com/ in VB.NET

This project will be private until the day I either get banned from the site or I get bored of it. I had done a similar bot about 10 years ago for https://www.pokemonbattlearena.net/ but never saved the source. I want to make a new bot since now I am older and this type of thing was very fun for me in my youth. I am by no means a professinal programmer and this code is only for my own enjoyment.

Was banned while just testing the program. Looks like the site has something implemented that detects people performing the same actions over and over. Or maybe it could be because the site see's me switching between browsers. Don't really care enough to figure out how, but good on them. Got some of the basic code working but obviously unfinished. Not fully tested but a nice POC for anyone interested. Use at your own risk.
